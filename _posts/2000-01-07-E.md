***Past Life*** is a work for solo Trumpet. An exploration of Hungarian folk music, this piece features a mournful and melismatic solo melody that is highlighted by the dark and brooding tonal quality of the Trumpet. The wide use of traditional Hungarian melodies in conjunction with modern harmonic techniques and a cadenza-like style works to draw the listener into their own mind and imagine a past life.

***Cristian Palage*** (b. 2001) is a classically trained trumpet player, electronic music producer and composer from Kitchener, Ontario, Canada. He is currently studying Computer Science in the faculty of Mathematics at the University of Waterloo and is strongly interested in the intersection of art and technology. As a performer, Cristian is experienced in both classical and commercial contexts, including as first trumpet with the Kitchener-Waterloo Symphony Youth Orchestra, and as a recording artist for PANToNE VU, and Juno nominated band The Wild Strawberries. As a composer, Cristian’s work is heavily influenced by soviet era composers such as Arutunian, Peskin and Pakhumutova; as well as the likes of Mahler, Bartók and Kodály. His work focuses on rich melodies and ambiguous harmonies that seek to provoke the listener and heighten their emotional response.
